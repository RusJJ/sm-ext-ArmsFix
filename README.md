Fixes glove overlapping with custom arms

###Building on Windows
Maybe you can use AMBuild, but i dont know ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
If you're installed your Visual Studio to NON-default directory, simply change a directory in build.bat
Launch build.bat!

###Building on Linux
You need GCC/CLang compiler installed!
Open an extension project folder (sm-ext-ArmsFix now?) and open Terminal (or manually use cd)
In terminal: bash build.sh
